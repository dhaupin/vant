# Vant Axolotl — Crash Memory (MEM.md)

> **Purpose of this file:** catch-all scratchpad. Dump whatever you're in the middle of, in case the session dies before a full save/commit. Treat it as a tmp space, not a ledger.
> **After a clean session:** wipe back to this template and leave a one-line handoff.

## Handoff

**Last known good commit:** see `git log --oneline -3` (TASKS.md latest session block has the verified record)
**Branch:** axolotl — origin github.com/dhaupin/vant
**Status:** clean sessions end with everything committed + pushed; this dump should be the template again.

## CURRENT DUMP

(nothing in flight — docs/CI consistency pass shipped at `1c72809`:
standalone suites now in GitHub Actions discovery, CHANGELOG entries for
migration + QC fixes, mcp-tools.md gained brain_migration_status and
stale tool-counts replaced with auto-wire phrasing everywhere, cli.md
documents failed-verify retry + existing-wins + health warning, .gitignore
covers legacy-main fixture + .drill-* scratch. All suites / runner 37-37 /
CI 421-0-3 green. Branch is PR #91-ready; user decides on merge.)

## Crash-Restore Procedure

1. `git status && git log --oneline -10` — confirm branch `axolotl`
2. Read `labs/TASKS.md` top session block — current state + next steps
3. Read `models/private/buffy/learnings.md` — hard-won patterns
4. Check this dump section for anything in flight
5. `node test/runner.js` — verify baseline before touching anything
